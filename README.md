HabboImager
======================
This branch is a complete program by itself, and works fully standalone, but still does require internet access.
This readme file should be removed from the files downloaded.
Compile using Visual Studio 2010 or greater (by running the HabboImager.sln file. Their file structure must match how it is as when downloaded).

======================
Information
======================
A desktop, C# based program alternative for generating Habbo Avatar images, rendering the need for the ones available on fansites useless.
